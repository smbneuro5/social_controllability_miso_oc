Contents of Social Controllability Modeling:

For original code and a more detailed step-by-step guide, see https://github.com/SoojungNa/social_controllability_fMRI

1. Analyze behavioral data

	1.1 Raw data can be downloaded from 0.data folder (https://github.com/smbneuro5/	social_controllability_miso_oc/SocialControllability_Modeling/0.data)

	1.2 To get behavioral results, open “run.m” ("run.m" is at https://github.com/smbneuro5/	social_controllability_miso_oc/SocialControllability_Modeling/1.beh). Change paths where 
	necessary (input and output directories, input should be beh_noFlat_1342.mat')

	1.3 Run “run.m”

	1.4 “results.mat" will be generated. This file has the variables as below.
		"ID" - participants' ids
		"Mname"
			- Eight strings represents the labels for each pair of the columns of "M"
			- 'offer': Mean offer throughout 40 trials
			- 'rejR': Mean rejection rate
			- 'rejR_L': Mean rejection rate for low offers ($1-3)
			- 'rejR_M': Mean rejection rate for medium offers ($4-6)
			- 'rejR_H': Mean rejection rate for high offers ($7-9)
			- 'reward': Mean reward
			- 'emo': Mean self-reported emotion ratings
			- 'pc': Self-reported perceived control ratings
		"M" (@)
			- Odd columns are the "Controllable" condition.
			- Even columns are the "Uncontrollable" condition.
			- The labels for each pair of the columns are in "Mname".
			- Each row matches with each participant in the same order as in "ID".
		"M_mean" (@)
			- Mean of "M" across the participants
		“M_std" (@)
			- Standard deviation for "M" across the participants 
		"stat_ICvNC" (@)
			- statistical testing results to compare b/w C (Controllable) and U (Uncontrollable)
			- 'columns': column labels for 'f_var', 'pt_mean', 't_mean_uneqvar'
			- 'rows': row labels for 'f_var', 'pt_mean', 't_mean_uneqvar'			
			- 'f_var': Results of F-test for variance difference
			- 'pt_mean': Results of t-test for mean difference assuming equal variance
			- 't_mean_uneqvar': Results of t-test for mean difference assuming unequal 
			variance

2. Model fitting 

	2.1. open "nRv_6models_cap2_t20_30trials_IC.m" (for Controllable; use "~ NC.m" for 
	Uncontrollable) (These files are at https://github.com/smbneuro5/		
	social_controllability_miso_oc/SocialControllability_Modeling/2.model)

	2.2. Change paths where necessary (input and output directories, input should be 
	beh_noFlat_1342.mat') 

	2.3. run it.

	2.4. "nRv_6models_cap2_t20_30trials_IC.mat" will be generated. Open the file and you will 	
	see:
		"Model"
			- The model list
			- MF=model-free; f0=0step; fD=1step; f3=2step; f4=3step; f5=4step
		"BIC" (@)
			- BIC scores for each model (columns; corresponds to "Model") and each 
			particiant (rows)		
		"freeName"
			- parameter names
		"freeID"
			- rows correspond to "Model"
			- columns correspond to "freeName"
			- 1=set free; 0=not used or fixed.		
		"param" (@)
			- parameter estimates
			- rows correspond to participants
			- columns correspond to freeName(parameters)
			- the 3rd dimension correspond to Model

3. Parameter extraction

	3.1 For model comparison, parameter recovery and accuracy, see  https://github.com/
	SoojungNa/social_controllability_fMRI

	3.2 For the purposes of this paper, given published results from out group in the same sample 
	(Na et. al., 2021, DOI: 10.7554/eLife.64983) showing the 2-step model as the best fit, we 
	extracted the parameters from the 2-step model to perform our statistical analyses (see https://
	github.com/smbneuro5/social_controllability_miso_oc/TransdiagnosticFactor_Stats)
